## What is Quary?

Quary enables teams to model, test and deploy data transformations. This core is a fast (30x faster than dbt to be precise!) and lightweight SQL transformation engine written in Rust.

- Visit [our documentation](https://www.quary.dev/docs) to learn how to use Quary

## Understanding Quary

Teams use Quary to transform their raw data tables in a data warehouse into actionable trustworthy insights. Users can easily transform their data by writing SQL select statements, which Quary then converts into tables and views within the data warehouse.

A Quary project is formed by a collection of these select statements, also known as models. These models often build upon one another, creating a structured flow of data transformation. Quary simplifies the process of visualizing dependencies from the source (raw table) to the final insight. Additionally, it provides testing capabilities for the models at each stage, ensuring data integrity and accuracy.

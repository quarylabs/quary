## What is Quary?

Quary enables teams to design, document, test and deploy data transformations to your SQL data stores. Quary is a SQL
engine and CLI tool that lets you manage your data transformation projects with ease.

Teams use Quary to transform their raw data tables into actionable and trustworthy insights. Teams do so by layering
well documented and tested transformations into useful insights ready for consumption. A Quary project is formed of a
collection of these SQL `SELECT` statements, that build on top of each other.
